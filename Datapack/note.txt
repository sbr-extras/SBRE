This datapack is an OVERLAY pack.

Meaning this does not overwrite MOST of the data SBR keeps.

Data Overwritten:
reload.mcfunction
tick.mcfunction
player_join.mcfunction (forgot the exact name but its with tick & reload)
ability_list.mcfunction
open_menus.mcfunction
main.mcfunction (data/menu/functions/cheats/get_items/other)

pack.mcmeta

(there might be more but this is what I recall from memory.)

This copy of SBRE is for SBR v1.0 (public release 1).
DO NOT USE THIS ON ANY OTHER VERSION AS IT WILL MOST LIKELY BREAK SBR!
