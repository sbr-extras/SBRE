# Skyblock Remake Extras
is just like Skyblock Extras (for the real Hypixel Skyblock) but for BlueCommander's remake.

# Credit Given Where Credit is Due
The entire Hypixel Skyblock Remake was remade by BlueCommander and his many developers. Do note when playing this that I DID NOT MAKE THE REMAKE. Please subscribe to BlueCommander on YouTube and join his Discord.

# Finding Releases
SBRE Releases can be found in the **releases** tab of GitHub while *SBRE-beta* can be found in the **SBRE-Beta** GitHub repo and in releases.

While in releases, decide now if you want to install SBRE using the: 
- **.bat** installer (easier but risker if you are paranoid and doesn't work on macOS "yet")
- or manually installing the datapack. (if you have already have a multiplayer server using PaperSpigot that you have running the SBR, then you have to use this method)

# Installing (via the .bat installer: WINDOWS ONLY)
1. Download SBRE (or SBRE-beta) from GitHub. (note: DO NOT DOWNLOAD SBRE OR SBRE-BETA FROM OTHER SOURCES. THIS IS THE ONLY OFFICIAL SOURCE FOR SBRE.) (assuming that you already have Java installed)
	a. If you are REALLY paranoid about being safe (you should be with this) then you can check VirusTotal with the *.bat* file or check if the hashes match the ones in GitHub Releases (in both SBRE and SBRE-beta)
2. Run the installer. (extra steps are down below)
	a. Before running, make sure you run the installer (this is the risky part) as Administrator. Then ensure the *.jar* file is located in the same directory as the installer.
	b. If your Minecraft directory is the one shown there (%appdata%\.minecraft) then press Enter. Else, type in your Minecraft directory.
	c. It will copy the new datapack to your copy of the remake.
	
	From here you can join your world and you will have SBRE installed.
	
# Installing (manually)
1. Download SBRE (or SBRE-beta) from GitHub and download SBR (Skyblock Remake) from "https://www.bluecommander.net/hypixel-skyblock-remake.html" (assuming that you already have Java installed)
2. Drag the SBRE world folder into your "saves" folder in your .minecraft directory.
	a. NOTE: This will NOT overwrite your data on SBR.
