# Bin Files
.bin (or Binary) files are used by SBRE to run commands. The plugins reads the binary files and executes the commands accordingly.

# Different Data Pack
Because SBRE adds features that aren't already in SBR, the *Data Pack* is required to swap for SBRE to work. The data pack is updated each time SBR updates to ensure that SBRE stays up-to-date and so SBRE doesn't implement dups.

# What are "Dups"
The term "dups" in SBRE means a duplicate feature in SBR and SBRE. For example, if SBRE adds Catacombs levels, but then SBR implements Catacombs levels in the next update, the SBRE feature would be removed because it is a "dup" or duplicate feature.
